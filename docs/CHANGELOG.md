## Version 1.5.8

## Version 1.5.7

- Fix bug when creating a zip archive using a temporary empty file, some php versions return
  `ZipArchive::ER_NOZIP (19)`, to fix it the library open the archive using flag `ZipArchive::OVERWRITE`.

## Version 1.5.6

- Add `ResultProvider` to use a `DBAL\Result` as the source of a `Provider`
- ResultProvider does not implement its own methods, it simply extends `ProviderIterator`
- RecordsetProvider does not use its own implementation, now it extends `ProviderIterator` 
  since the `DBAL\Å–ecordset` objects implements the `\IteratorAggregate` interface
- `ProviderInterface` has a method count, make it extends `\Countable`
- `Styles\Alignment` write `wrapText` attribute if it was set, was only written if was true
- Remove docblock for casting `\DBAL\Result::getIterator` to `\Iterator` (fixed in upstream)
